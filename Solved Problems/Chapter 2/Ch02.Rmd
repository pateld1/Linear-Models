### Problem 1: 
A student working on a summer internship in the economic research department of a large corporation studied the relation between sales of a product ($Y$, in million dollars) and population ($X$, in million persons) in the firm's $50$ marketing districts. The normal error regresssion model was employed. The student first wished to test whether or not a linear association between $Y$ and $X$ existed. The student assessed a simple linear regression program and obtained the following information on the regression coefficients: 

| Parameter | Estimated Value |   95% Confidence Limits   | 
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------| 
|Intercept  | 7.43119         |   -1.18518  |    16.0476  |
|Slope      | .755048         |   .452886   |     1.05721 | 

(a) The student concluded from these results that there is a linear association between $Y$ and $X$. Is the conclusion warranted? What is the implied level of significance? 

Answer: This conclusion is warranted because the slope is nonzero. The implied level of significance is 5%.

(b) Someone questioned the negative lower confidence limit for the intercept, pointing out that dollar sales cannot be negative even if the population in a district is zero. Discuss.

Answer: The context of the study must always be taken into consideration when evaluating regression results. Since dollar sales cannot be negative, a negative lower confidence limit is meaningless and should be understood as 0.00.


### Problem 2: 
In a test of the alternatives $H_0: \beta_1 \leq 0$ versus $H_A: \beta_1 > 0$, an analyst concluded $H_0$. Does this conclusion imply that there is no linear association between $X$ and $Y$? Explain.

Answer: By concluding $H_0$, the null hypothesis is failed to be rejected. This means that it can still be the case that $\beta_1 \leq 0$. This has two meanings, either $\beta_1 = 0$ signifying no linear association between $X$ and $Y$, or $\beta_1 < 0$, signifying a negative linear association between $X$ and $Y$. Thus it is not impliable that there is no linear association.


### Problem 3: 
A member of a student team playing an interactive marketing game received the following computer output when studying the relation between advertising expenditures ($X$) and sales ($Y$) for one of the team's products: 

Estimated regression equation: $\hat{Y} = 350.7 - .18X$
Two-sided $P$-value for estimated slope: $.91$

The student states: "The message I get here is that the more we spend on advertising this product, the fewer units we sell!" Comment.

Answer: The two-sided $p$-value for estimated slope is large; at an alpha level of $.05$, the $p$-value is greater and the result for the estimated slope cannot be used to create inferences about the relationship between advertisements and sales. 


### Problem 4: 
Refer to *Grade point average* Problem 1.19.

(a) Obtain a $99$ percent confidence interval for $\beta_1$. Interpret your confidence interval. Does it include zero? Why might the director of admissions be interested in whether the confidence interval includes zero?

Answer: 
```{r}
gpa = read.csv('CH01PR19.txt', sep = '', header = FALSE, 
               col.names = c('y', 'x'), 
               colClasses = c('numeric', 'numeric'))

b1_conf_interval = function(data, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  sum_sq_Xbar = sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse / sum_sq_Xbar)
  error = t*se
  lower = round(b1 - error, 5)
  upper = round(b1 + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```

The confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is
```{r}
b1_conf_interval(gpa, alpha = .01)
```

At a confidence of 99%, the mean ACT test score increases somewhere between $.00539$ and $.07227$ for each unit increase in the student's GPA score. The confidence interval does not include zero. It would be of importance if there was a zero because it would mean that the ACT test score does not increase when the GPA score increases on average. 


(b) Test, using the test statistic $t^*$, whether or not a linear association exists between student's ACT score ($X$) and GPA at the end of the freshman year ($Y$). Use a level of significance of $.01$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion.

Answer: 
```{r}
b1_test = function(data, beta1 = 0, alpha = .01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  sum_sq_Xbar = sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  se = sqrt(mse / sum_sq_Xbar)
  t_ast = (b1 - beta1) /se
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  
  print(paste("t* =", round(t_ast, 5)))
  if(abs(t_ast) > t){return("Conclude H_A")}
  else{return("Conclude H_0")}
}
```

For this test, let $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ (no linear association between student's ACT score and GPA) and $H_A: \beta_1 \neq 0$ (there is linear association). Then the following $t$ statistic is computed and decision is made:
```{r}
b1_test(gpa, alpha = .01)
```

By the results of this hypothesis test, it can be concluded that there is a linear association between the ACT test scores and the students' GPA. 

(c) What is the $P$-value of your test in part (b)? How does it support the conclusion reached in part (b)?

Answer: 
```{r}
b1_test_pval = function(data, beta1 = 0, two.sided = FALSE){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  sum_sq_Xbar = sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  se = sqrt(mse / sum_sq_Xbar)
  t_ast = (b1 - beta1) /se
  pval = pt(t_ast, nrow(data)-2, lower.tail = FALSE)
  
  if(two.sided){return(round(2*pval, 5))}
  else(return(round(pval, 5)))
}
```

The $p$-value of the test is
```{r}
b1_test_pval(gpa, two.sided = TRUE)
```

Since this $p$-value is less than $\alpha = .01$, reject $H_0$ and accept $H_A$. This is the same conclusion reached in part (b).


### Problem 5: 
Refer to *Copier maintenance* Problem 1.20.

(a) Estimate the change in the mean service time when the number of copiers serviced increases by one. Use a $90$ percent confidence interval Interpret your confidence interval.

Answer:
```{r}
copier = read.csv('CH01PR20.txt', sep = '', header = FALSE, 
                  col.names = c('y', 'x'), 
                  colClasses = c('numeric', 'numeric'))

b1_conf_interval(copier, alpha = .1)
```

With 90% confidence, the change in the mean service time when the number of copiers serviced increases by one is between $14.22314$ and $15.84735$. 

(b) Conduct a $t$ test to determine whether or not there is a linear association between $X$ and $Y$ here; control the $\alpha$ risk at $.10$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion. What is the $P$-value of your test?

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that there is no linear association between service time and number of copiers. Let the alternative hypothesis be that there is a linear association. Then by the $t$ test, 
```{r}
b1_test(copier, alpha = .1)
```

There is a linear association between $X$ and $Y$. The $p$-value of the test is
```{r}
b1_test_pval(copier, two.sided = TRUE)
```


(c) Are your results in part (a) and (b) consistent? Explain.

Answer: The results in part (a) and (b) are consistent; both tell that there is a linear association between $X$ and $Y$.

(d) The manufacturer has suggested that the mean required time should not increase by more than $14$ minutes for each additional copier that is serviced on a service call. Conduct a test to decide whether this standard is being satisfied by Tri-City. Control the risk of a Type I error at $.05$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion. What is the $P$-value of the test?

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that the mean required time is less than or equal to $14$ minutes and the alternative hypothesis be that the mean required time is greater than $14$ minutes. Then the decision rule is
```{r}
b1_test(copier, beta1 = 14, alpha = .05)
```

According to the $t$ test, the mean required time is greater than $14$ minutes. The standard given by the manufacturer is no being satisfied by Tri-City. The $p$-value of the test is
```{r}
b1_test_pval(copier, beta1 = 14)
```

Since the $p$ value is less than $\alpha = .01$, the null is rejected and the alternative is accepted. This is the same conclusion made above.

(e) Does $b_0$ give any relevant information here about the "start-up" time on calls - i.e., about the time required before service work is begun on the copiers at a customer location? 

```{r}
lm.fit_manual = function(X, Y){
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  return(c(b0, b1))
}

lm.fit_manual(copier$x, copier$y)
```

According to the linear regression model, the $b_0$ coefficient is $-0.58$. This value is negative, implying negative time. It is meaningless in this context. It does not give any relevant information about the "start-up" time on calls.

### Problem 6:
Refer to *Airfreight breakage* Problem 1.21.

(a) Estimate $\beta_1$ with a $95$ percent confidence interval. Interpret your interval estimate.

Answer: 
```{r}
airfreight = read.csv('CH01PR21.txt', sep = '', header = FALSE, 
                  col.names = c('y', 'x'), 
                  colClasses = c('numeric', 'numeric'))
b1_conf_interval(airfreight, alpha = .05)
```

At the alpha level of $.05$, the number of broken ampules is estimated to increase between $2.91839$ and $5.08161$ for each time a carton is transferred.

(b) Conduct a $t$ test to decide whether or not there is a linear association between number of times a carton is transferred ($X$) and number of broken ampules ($Y$). Use a level of significance of $.05$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion. What is the $P$-value of the test? 

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that there is no linear association between number of times a carton is transferred and number of broken ampules. Let the alternative hypothesis be that there is a linear association between the two. Then the decision rule is 
```{r}
b1_test(airfreight, alpha = .05)
```

There is a linear association between the two variables. The $p$-value of this test is
```{r}
b1_test_pval(airfreight, two.sided = TRUE)
```

(c) $\beta_0$ represents here the mean number of ampules broken when no transfers of the shipment are made, i.e., when $X=0$. Obtain a $95$ percent confidence interval for $\beta_0$ and interpret it.

Answer: 
```{r}
b0_conf_interval = function(data, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  se_estimator = nrow(data)^(-1) + (mean(X)^2 / sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse * se_estimator)
  error = t*se
  lower = round(b0 - error, 5)
  upper = round(b0 + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```


The $95$ percent confidence interval for $\beta_0$ is
```{r}
b0_conf_interval(airfreight, alpha = .05)
```

When there are no transfers of the shipment made, the mean number of ampules broken lies between $8.67037$ and $11.72963$ with $95\%$ confidence. 

(d) A consultant has suggested, on the basis of previous experience, that the mean number of broken ampules should not exceed $9.0$ when no transfers are made. Conduct an appropriate test, using $\alpha = .025$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion. What is the $P$-value of the test?

Answer: 
```{r}
b0_test_pval = function(data, beta0 = 0, two.sided = FALSE){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  se_estimator = nrow(data)^(-1) + (mean(X)^2 / sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  se = sqrt(mse * se_estimator)
  t_ast = (b0 - beta0) / se
  pval = pt(t_ast, nrow(data)-2, lower.tail = FALSE)
  
  if(two.sided){return(round(2*pval, 5))}
  else(return(round(pval, 5)))
}
```

Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_0 \leq 9$ and the alternative that $\beta_0 > 9$. Then at an alpha level of $.025$, the p-value is 
```{r}
b0_test_pval(airfreight, beta0 = 9)
```

Since this value is not less than $\alpha$, fail to reject $H_0$; there is no sufficient evidence that the mean number of broken ampules will not exceed $9.0$ when no transfers are made.

(e) Obtain the power of your test in part (b) if actually $\beta_1 = 2.0$. Assume $\sigma[b_1] = .50$. Also obtain the power of your test in part (d) if actually $\beta_0 = 11$. Assume $\sigma[b_0] = .75$. 

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_1 = 9$ for the first scenario. Then 
$$ \delta = \frac{\lvert 2-0 \rvert}{.5} = 4 $$ 
```{r}
power_test = function(data, conf = .95, delta = 0){
  
  t = qt(conf, df = nrow(data) - 2)
  df = nrow(data) -2 
  p = pt(t, df = df, ncp = delta) - pt(-t, df = df, ncp = delta)
  return(1-p)
  
}
```

Then the power of the test is
```{r}
power_test(airfreight, conf = .975, delta = 4)
```

For the second scenario, let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_0 = 11$. Then
$$ \delta = \frac{\lvert 11 - 9 \rvert}{.75} = \frac{8}{3} $$

Then the power of the test is
```{r}
power_test(airfreight, conf = .95, delta = 8/3)
```


### Problem 7:
Refer to *Plastic Hardness* Problem 1.22.

(a) Estimate the change in the mean hardness when the elapsed time increases by one hour. Use a $99$ percent confidence interval. Interpret your interval estimate.

Answer: 
```{r}
plastic = read.csv('CH01PR22.txt', sep = '', header = FALSE, 
                  col.names = c('y', 'x'), 
                  colClasses = c('numeric', 'numeric'))

b1_conf_interval(plastic, alpha = .01)
```

When the elapsed time increases by one hour, the change in the mean hardness ranges from $1.76529$ to $2.30346$ with $99\%$ confidence.

(b) The plastic manufacturer has stated that the mean hardness should increase by $2$ Brinell units per hour. Conduct a two-sided test to decide whether this standard is being satisfied; use $\alpha = .01$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion. What is the $P$-value of the test?

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_1 = 2$ and the alternative that $\beta_1 \neq 2$. Then the $p$-value of this test is
```{r}
b1_test_pval(plastic, beta1 = 2, two.sided = TRUE)
```

Since this $p$ value is larger than $\alpha = .01$, fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no sufficient evidence that the mean hardness should increase by $2$ Brinell units per hour.

(c) Obtain the power of your test in part (b) if the standard actually is being exceeded by $.3$ Brinell units per hour. Assume $\sigma[b_1] = .1$.

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_1 = .3$. Then
$$ \delta = \frac{\lvert .3 \rvert}{.1} = 3$$ 

Then the power of the test is 
```{r}
power_test(plastic, conf = .99, delta = 3)
```


### Problem 8: 
Refer to Figure 2.2 for the Toluca Company example. A consultant has advised that an increase of one unit in a lot size should require an increase of $3.0$ in the expected number of work hours for the given production item.

![](toluca_reg_output.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}

(a) Conduct a test to decide whether or not the increase in the expected number of work hours in the Toluca Company equals this standard. Use $\alpha = .05$. State the alternatives, decision rule and conclusion.

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_1 = 3$ and the alternative that $\beta_1 \neq 3$. Then by inputting in the values from the MINITAB output, the calculated $t$ value is,
```{r}
(3.57 - 3)/.3470
```

Now, $t_{.975, 23}$ is
```{r}
qt(.975, 23)
```

The calculated $t$ value is less than the $t$ statistic above. Hence fail to reject $H_0$; there is no sufficient evidence that the increase in the expected number of work hours in the Toluca Company equals $3.0$.

(b) Obtain the power of your test in part (a) if the consultant's standard actually is being exceeded by $.5$ hour. Assume $\sigma[b_1] = .35$.

Answer: Let the null hypothesis be that $\beta_1 = .5$. Then
$$ \delta = \frac{\lvert .5 \rvert}{.35} = \frac{10}{7} $$ 

Then the power of the test is
```{r}
power_test(data.frame(rep(2020, 25)), conf = .95, delta = 10/7)
```

(c) Why is $F^* = 105.88$, given in the printout, not relevant for the test in part (a)? 

Answer: The $F$ statistic is not relevant for the $t$ test in part (a) because the hypothesis $\beta_1 = 0$ was not being tested. 


### Problem 9: 
Refer to Figure 2.2. A student, noting that, $s[b_1]$ is furnished in the printout, asks why $s[\hat{Y}_h]$ is not also given. Discuss.

Answer: $\hat{Y}_h$ refers to any single predicted $Y$ value. The variability of the sampling distribution of $\hat{Y}_h$ is affected by how far $X_h$ is from $\overline{X}$, through the term $(X_h - \overline{X})^2$. The standard deviation of $\hat{Y}_h$ would differ point by point and cannot be given for a regression line.


### Problem 10: 
For each of the following questions, explain whether a confidence interval for a mean response or a prediction interval for a new observation is appropriate.

(a) What will be the humidity level in this greenhouse tomorrow when we set the temperature at $31^\circ C$? 

Answer: A prediction interval for a new observation would be appropriate here.

(b) How much do families whose disposable income is $\$23,500$ spend, on the average, for meals away from home?

Answer: A confidence interval for a mean response would be appropriate here.

(c) How many kilowatts-hours of electricity will be consumed next month by commercial and industrial users in the Twin Cities service area, given that the index of business activity for the area remains at its present level? 

Answer: A prediction interval for a new observation would be appropriate here.


### Problem 11: 
A person asks if there is a difference between the "mean response at $X=X_h$" and the "mean of $m$ new observations at $X=X_h$". Reply.

Answer: There is a difference between the "mean response at $X=X_h$" and the "mean of $m$ new observations at $X=X_h$ because the former samples one new point and the latter samples $m$ new points.


### Problem 12: 
Can $\sigma^2[\text{pred}]$ be brought increasingly close to $0$ as $n$ becomes large? Is this also the case for $\sigma^2[\hat{Y}_h]$? What is the implication of this difference? 

Answer: As $n$ becomes large, $\sigma^2[\text{pred}]$ cannot be brought increasingly closer to $0$ due to the presense of the $\sigma^2$ and $\sigma^2[\hat{Y}_h]$. This is the same for $\sigma^2[\hat{Y}_h]$ because it is dependent on a term for the deviation of $X_h$ from $\overline{X}$. The implication of the difference is that one depends on the variance of one new point and the other depends on the the variance of $n$ new points. 


### Problem 13: 
Refer to *Grade point average* Problem 1.19.

(a) Obtain a $95$ percent interval estimate of the mean freshman GPA for students whose ACT test score is $28$. Interpret your confidence interval.

Answer: 
```{r}
gpa = read.csv('CH01PR19.txt', sep = '', header = FALSE, 
               col.names = c('y', 'x'), 
               colClasses = c('numeric', 'numeric'))

Yhat_conf_interval = function(data, Xhat, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  Yhat = b0 + b1*Xhat
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  var_adjust = (1/nrow(data)) + ((Xhat - mean(X))^2)/sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse * var_adjust)
  error = t*se
  lower = round(Yhat - error, 5)
  upper = round(Yhat + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```

The confidence interval is
```{r}
Yhat_conf_interval(gpa, Xhat = 28, alpha = .05)
```

(b) Mary Jones obtained a score of $28$ on the entrance test. Predict her freshman GPA using a $95$ percent prediction interval. Interpret your prediction interval.

Answer: 
```{r}
Yhat_pred_interval = function(data, Xhat, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  Yhat = b0 + b1*Xhat
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  var_adjust = (1/nrow(data)) + ((Xhat - mean(X))^2)/sum((X - mean(X))^2) + 1
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse * var_adjust)
  error = t*se
  lower = round(Yhat - error, 5)
  upper = round(Yhat + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```

The prediction interval is
```{r}
Yhat_pred_interval(gpa, Xhat = 28, alpha = .05)
```

(c) Is the prediction interval in part (b) wider than the confidence interval in part (a)? Should it be? 

Answer: The prediction interval in part (b) is wider than the confidence interval in part (a). This was expected due to the added variability in $\hat{Y}$.

(d) Determine the boundary value of the $95$ percent confidence band for the regression line when $X_h = 28$. Is your confidence band wider at this point than the confidence interval in part (a)? Should it be? 

Answer: 
```{r}
conf_band_reg = function(data, Xhat, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  W = sqrt(2* qf(1 - alpha, 2, df))
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  Yhat = b0 + b1*Xhat
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  var_adjust = (1/nrow(data)) + ((Xhat - mean(X))^2)/sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse * var_adjust)
  error = W*se
  lower = round(Yhat - error, 5)
  upper = round(Yhat + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```

The boundary values of the $95$ percent confidence band for the regression line when $X_h = 28$ is
```{r}
conf_band_reg(gpa, 28, alpha = .05)
```

The confidence band is wider at this point than the confidence band in part (a), as was expected.

### Problem 14: 
Refer to *Copier maintenance* Problem 1.20.

(a) Obtain a $90$ percent confidence interval for the mean service time on calls in which six copiers are serviced. Interpret your confidence interval.

Answer: The $90$ percent confidence interval for the mean service time on calls in which six copiers are serviced is
```{r}
Yhat_conf_interval(copier, Xhat = 6, alpha = .1)
```

(b) Obtain a $90$ percent prediction interval for the service time on the next call in which six copiers are serviced. Is your prediction interval wider than the corresponding confidence interval in part (a)? Should it be? 

Answer: The $90$ percent prediction interval is
```{r}
Yhat_pred_interval(copier, Xhat = 6, alpha = .1)

(c) In the next several days, three independent shipments will be made, each entailing two transfers. Obtain a $99$ percent prediction interval for the mean number of ampules broken in the three shipments. Convert this interval into a $99$ percent prediction interval for the total number of ampules broken in the three shipments.

Answer: 
```{r}
Yhat_m_pred_interval = function(data, Xhat, m, alpha = 0.01){
  
  X = data[['x']]
  Y = data[['y']]
  df = nrow(data) - 2
  b1 = sum((X - mean(X))*(Y - mean(Y))) / (sum((X - mean(X))^2))
  b0 = mean(Y) - b1*mean(X)
  Ypred = b0 + b1*X
  Yhat = b0 + b1*Xhat
  mse = sum((Y - Ypred)^2) / df
  var_adjust = (1/nrow(data)) + (1/m) + ((Xhat - mean(X))^2)/sum((X - mean(X))^2)
  t = qt(1 - (alpha/2), df = df)
  se = sqrt(mse * var_adjust)
  error = t*se
  lower = round(Yhat - error, 5)
  upper = round(Yhat + error, 5)
  return(c(lower, upper))
}
```

The $99$ percent prediction interval for the mean number of ampules broken in the three shipments is
```{r}
Yhat_m_pred_interval(airfreight, Xhat = 2, m = 3, alpha = .01)
```

The $99$ percent prediction interval for the total number of broken ampules in the three shipments is then
```{r}
3*Yhat_m_pred_interval(airfreight, Xhat = 2, m = 3, alpha = .01)
```

(d) Determine the boundary values of the $99$ percent confidence band for the regression line when $X_h=2$ and when $X_h=4$. Is your confidence band wider at these two points than the corresponding confidence intervals in part (a)? Should it be?

```{r}
conf_band_reg(airfreight, Xhat = 2, alpha = .01)
```

The boundary values of the $99$ percent confidence band for the regression line when $X_h = 4$ is
```{r}

Refer to the *SENIC* data set in Appendix C.1 and Project 1.46. Obtain a separate interval estimate of $\beta_1$ for each region. Use a $95$ percent confidence coefficient in each case. Do the regression lines for the different regions appear to have similar slopes? 

Answer: 


### Problem 66: 
Five observations on $Y$ are to be taken when $X=4$, $8$, $12$, $16$ and $20$ respectively. The true regression function is $E[Y] = 20 + 4X$ and the $\varepsilon_i$ are independent $N(0, 25)$. 

(a) Generate five normal random numbers, with mean $0$ and variance $25$. Consider these random numbers as the error terms for the five $Y$ observations at $X=4$, $8$, $12$, $16$ and $20$ and calculate $Y_1$, $Y_2$, $Y_3$, $Y_4$ and $Y_5$. Obtain the least squares estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$ when fitting a straight line to the five cases. Also calculate $\hat{Y}_h$ when $X_h = 10$ and obtain a $95$ percent confidence interval for $E[Y_h]$ when $X_h = 10$.

Answer: 

(b) Repeat part (a) $200$ times, generating random numbers each time.

Answer: 

(c) Make a frequency distribution of the $200$ estimates $b_1$. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the $200$ estimates $b_1$. Are the results consistent with theoretical expectations? 

Answer: 

(d) What proportion of the $200$ confidence intervals for $E[Y_h]$ when $X_h=10$ include $E[Y_h]$? Is this result consistent with theoretical expectations? 

Answer: 


### Problem 67: 
Refer to *Grade point average* Problem 1.19.

(a) Plot the data, with the least squares regression line for ACT scores between $20$ and $30$ superimposed.

Answer: 

(b) On the plot in part (a), superimpose a plot of the $95$ percent confidence band for the true regression line for ACT scores between $20$ and $30$. Does the confidence band suggest that the true regression relation has been precisely estimated? Discuss.

Answer: 


### Problem 68: 
Refer to *Copier maintenance* Problem 1.20.

(a) Plot the data, with the least squares regression line for number of copiers serviced between $1$ and $8$ superimposed.

Answer: 

(b) On the plot in part (a), superimpose a plot of the $90$ percent confidence band for the true regression line for number of copiers serviced between $1$ and $8$. Does the confidence band suggest that the true regression relation has been precisely estimated? Discuss.
